#write a program to assign values to two variables using assignment and after that add 1 to both variables.

x,y = 10, 20            # assign values x=10 and y=20 using comman
x,y =  x+1, y+1           # now add 1 value to both variable and assign using comman

print(x, y)       # now print value of x and y;
